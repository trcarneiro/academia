# Google Ads API Access Application - Short Form

---

## Company Information

**Company Name:** Academia Krav Maga

**Business Type:** Martial Arts Training Academy

**Country:** Brazil

---

## Business Model

My company operates a martial arts training academy specializing in Krav Maga and self-defense. We manage Google Ads campaigns exclusively for our own academy to promote our training programs (beginner courses, advanced classes, personal training). We only advertise for our own academy and don't manage ads for anyone else.

---

## Tool Access/Use

My tool is going to be used by marketing managers and CRM administrators within my academy to view and generate reports on lead generation and ad performance. We will have both a CRM dashboard and the ability to generate performance reports. We may send PDF reports generated by our tool to our marketing consultant, but they will not be able to access the tool directly.

We will also have a script that will run hourly to sync lead data and upload conversion events when students enroll.

---

## Tool Design

For the reporting aspect of our tool, we will pull campaign metrics from the API into our PostgreSQL database. The UI of our tool will pull from this database to display reports. Users will have the option to view different levels of ad performance (campaigns, ad groups, leads) over different time periods.

My internal PostgreSQL database will sync with the Google Ads API hourly to update lead data and will upload offline conversions when leads become enrolled students.
